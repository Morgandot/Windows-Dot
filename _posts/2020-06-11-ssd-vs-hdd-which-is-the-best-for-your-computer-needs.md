<h2 id="1">Choosing the Best Hard Drive:</h2>
If you are planning to purchase a new computer or laptop, the most important specification that you want to consider is a hard drive. Even, if you want to upgrade your system, you have to know which hard drive is best for your system.

There are three types of drives such as Solid State Drive (SSD), Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and Solid State Hybrid Drive (SSHD). Most people will be stuck between SSD and HDD as they don't know which one wants to choose for their system. So, let's take a quick look at each type of drive.
<h2 id="2">Hard Disk Drive (HDD):</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>HDD is a traditional hard drive that has spinning disks where data is stored magnetically. It is lower in cost and it is considered to be a legacy technology. HDD will take the time to retrieve information from the HDD.</li>
 	<li>It requires physical movement to get any data. The arm moves the head across the surface of the disk to access different information.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3">Solid State Drive (SSD):</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>As the name implies, it does not have any moving parts. In this drive, all information is stored in integrated circuits. It is different from HDD in size and performance.</li>
 	<li>This drive is flexible for smaller devices and it decreases the access time as it doesn't have to wait for the start of platter rotation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4">SSD vs HDD:</h2>
<h3>Speed:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>SSD is the most popular choice because of its electrical circuitry usage. It does not have any moving parts. So, it reduces the waiting time and you can open any apps or do any sort of computing task quickly.</li>
 	<li>This quick data transfer enhances performance in many areas. You can copy any large file, open any apps, and even more at less time.</li>
 	<li>SSD can work on diverse tasks while HDD performance slows literally. Those who need to access files or data quickly should go with the SSD because of its fast performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gaming Experience:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Every gamer needs a PC drive that accesses data quickly. Video games contain an enormous amount of audio, textures, graphics, and even more.</li>
 	<li>If you try to load any again in HDD it will take three to four minutes but the SSD takes less than a minute.</li>
</ul>
