<h2 id="1">DLL Not Found in Visual Studio:</h2>
Running applications that are made with Microsoft Visual C++ will require a runtime library called Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable for using Visual Studio. The required version will be packaged within the installer by the applications that need the runtime library. You will obtain a link to download the redistributable if the required version is not packaged.

Sometimes, DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files will not be installed or registered during the installation process. If this is the case, then you may get the error as DLL not found or the application won't work properly.

<h2 id="2">Types of Error Messages:</h2>
Once you get the DLL not found error, you can't identify what type of error it is and how to fix it. In such cases, you have to understand the type of error message that occurs due to missing DLL files.
<ul>
 	<li>You will get an error message as 'The program can’t begin because <strong>MSVCP120.dll</strong> is missing from your device' so you will be asked to reinstall the program to fix the issue.</li>
 	<li>The error message may also look like 'The program can’t begin because <strong>MSVCR120.dll</strong> is missing from your PC' so you will be asked to reinstall the program to fix the issue.</li>
</ul>
These sorts of errors may also occur for DLL files that include msvcr80.dll, msvcr100.dll, msvcr120.dll, etc. Applications like XAMP, WAMP, MySQL, etc will need Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable so if the DLL file is missing, you will get the error messages.

<strong>3 types of Visual C++ DLL libraries:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>MFC: Microsoft Foundation Classes Library</li>
 	<li>MSVCP: Standard C++ Library</li>
 	<li>MSVCR: C Runtime Library (CRL)</li>
</ul>
See the <strong>Visual Studio version number</strong> at the end of each DLL file.
<ul>
 	<li>90: Visual Studio 2008 (Version 9.0)</li>
 	<li>100: Visual Studio 2010 (Version 10.0)</li>
 	<li>110: Visual Studio 2012 (Version 11.0)</li>
 	<li>120: Visual Studio 2013 (Version 12.0)</li>
 	<li>140: Visual Studio 2015 (Version 14.0)</li>
 	<li>150: Visual Studio 2017 (Version 15.0)</li>
 	<li>160: Visual Studio 2019 (Version 16.0)</li>
</ul>
Even, if you get different kinds of error messages, you can try the following solutions to fix the error.
<h2 id="3">Fix DLL missing or similar errors:</h2>
If you get an msvcr120.dll missing error, you try to reinstall VC++ redistributable. Once you are done with the reinstall process, missing DLL files will be included in precise locations automatically.
<ol>
 	<li>First, you have to identify the DLL file version. You just need to note down the last digits in the error message. For example, if it shows msvcr120.dll, you have to note down the 120.</li>
 	<li>Now, you have to compare the number with the Visual Studio version. If it is 120, then you have to install Visual C++ 2013 redistributable.</li>
 	<li>After that, you have to download <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VC++ distributable</a></strong>.</li>
 	<li>At last, you have to restart your system and run the application again to make sure the error gets fixed.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="4">Re-register DLL or similar files:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>You can re-register the DLL files if you get the error message even though you can find msvcr120.dll in C:\Windows\System32 folder.</li>
 	<li>You have to run regsvr32 msvcr120.dll on the Run command. So, it will re-register the DLL file and so the application will work without any issues.</li>
</ul>
