<h2 id="1">Photo Viewer in Windows 10:</h2>
Windows Photo Viewer will be available in PC's which are upgraded from Windows 7 or 8.1 to Windows 10. So, you can set it as your default photo viewer if you wish. Those who purchased a new PC with Windows 10 installed on it or performed a clean installation of Windows 10 cannot access it at all.

The fact is that Photo Viewer is still there but it is hidden and so you just need to make some changes in Registry to view it. After that, you can set it as your default photo viewer.
