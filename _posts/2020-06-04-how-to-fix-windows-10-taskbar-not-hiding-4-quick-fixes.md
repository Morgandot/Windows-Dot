<h2 id="1">Windows 10 Taskbar Not Hiding:</h2>
The Windows 10 Taskbar is the place where you can pin and access frequently used apps, you can see currently opened apps and other information that includes time, date, network, and more. It is possible to hide the Taskbar when you need extra space on your desktop while using any applications or playing games.

You can set the Taskbar to hide automatically and that functionality is available in your Windows system. The Taskbar will hide automatically when an application or program requires the full-screen mode. However, you may find that the <strong>Taskbar is not hiding</strong> even if the auto-hide option is enabled. This can be frustrating while watching high-quality movies or playing games.

Many users are facing this sort of problem where the Taskbar is not hiding in fullscreen mode.  Let’s see how we can resolve the issue of the Windows 10 taskbar not hiding.

 	<li>You just have to right-click on the empty area of the Taskbar. Choose <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</li>
