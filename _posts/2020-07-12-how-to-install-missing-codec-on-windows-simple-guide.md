<h2 id="1">Missing Codec on Windows:</h2>
<strong>Codec</strong> is a short-form of En<strong>co</strong>ding and <strong>Dec</strong>oding that indicates compressing and decompressing of a digital media file. It includes two components namely encoder, that compresses the media file and decoder, that decodes the same codec.

It is not possible to predict which codec is used to encode a media file by seeing its extension. Windows Media Player comes with a restricted number of codecs and so if you wish to play a media file that needs additional installation of a codec, you have to download and install it from the internet.
<h2 id="2">Check which Codes are installed in Windows:</h2>
Here, we will see two different ways to check which codes are installed in Windows.
<h3>Using Windows Media Player:</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>First, you have to open the <strong>Windows Media Player</strong>.</li>
 	<li>After that, you have to press <strong>Alt + H</strong> and navigate to the <strong>About Windows Media Player</strong> option.

</ol>
<h3>Using InstalledCodec:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>In addition to installed codecs, if you want to know more details regarding audio or video driver, then you can try <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/installed_codec.html"><strong>InstalledCodec</strong></a> which is a portable application from Nirsoft.</li>

 	<li>You can also try other applications that are used for a similar purpose like <a href="https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo"><strong>MediaInfo</strong></a>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3">Install the required Codec via VideoInspector:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>If you want to get clear-cut information about a video file, you can try this useful tool called <strong>VideoInspector</strong>.</li>
 	<li>You just need to browse through the video file so the details will be displayed in this tool automatically.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="4">Codec Packs to Install Common Audio &amp; Video Codecs:</h2>
A media codec pack requires for those who want to run all media files rather than finding what to install.  You have to install one of the following packs in order to use Windows Media Player or other players that do not come with pre-installed codecs.
<ul>
 	<li>K-Lite Codec Pack</li>
 	<li>Combined Community Codec Pack (CCCP)</li>
