<h2 id="1">Reasons to Change the Default Install Location:</h2>
In general, when you download any app or game from Microsoft Store it will install it in your C: drive or main system drive automatically. That's fine in most instances, but if you want to install any game that occupies more storage and <strong>you have a drive with limited storage</strong>, in such cases, you will end up with an error message 'free up your disk space'.

Fortunately, there is a solution to this issue. It is possible to switch the default location to save new apps from the Microsoft Store. You are not limited to install apps only in your C: drive or any particular drive. Even, you can use external storage for apps and games.

Further, you can also move already installed apps to a preferred location, and you can even choose a different location during download. Just follow any one of the two ways that are given below so you can <strong>change your default install location to any drive</strong> as per your own preference.

Changing the default install location in Windows 10 for apps will not move any of your currently installed apps. When apps receive updates they will remain in the location where they were originally installed.
