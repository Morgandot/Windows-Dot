<h2 id="1">Run Multiple Instances of a Program in Windows 10:</h2>
Running multiple instances of the same program is quite an easy task but most of the Windows users are not aware of it. Multitasking helps you to increase productivity and it saves your time. However, many programs or applications won't allow you to launch more than one window and open the active window twice or shows an error if you try to do it.

If you are looking for a solution, then you are in the right place. Thankfully, there are some ways to get rid of this limitation so you can open a program multiple times simultaneously. For example, if you wish to run the multiple instances of Skype or other programs, it is possible to do it by following the below methods.
<h2 id="2">1) Launch Multiple Instances of a Program that Supports this Feature:</h2>
There are some programs like MS Word, Notepad and other Document applications support multiple instances on its own. In such cases, you just need to follow any one of the below three ways to launch it.
<h3>Via Mouse:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>If an instance of a program (for example, Notepad) is already running, you just need to <strong>right-click on its icon in the Taskbar</strong> and then click on its program's name so it will open another instance immediately.</li>
 	<li>In another way, you just place the mouse pointer on the program icon and click on the mouse scroll once so it will open another instance quickly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Via Keyboard + Mouse:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>If an instance of a program (for example, Notepad) is already running, you just need to <strong>hold down the Shift key and left-click using the mouse on the program's icon in the Taskbar. </strong>So, it will open another instance immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Via Keyboard Shortcut:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>If an instance of a program is already running, you just need to <strong>press Windows key + Shift + 1-9, </strong>and so, it will open another instance immediately.</li>
 	<li>For example, Notepad is running and its icon is at 3rd position (from the Start button to the right) on the Taskbar, then you have to press Windows key + Shift + 3 to open another instance.</li>
 	<li>Likewise, if the program is at 1st position, you have to press Windows key + Shift + 1.</li>
</ul>
<p id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For this shortcut, you have to press the numbers at the top row above the alphabets.</p>

<h2 id="3">2) Use Different User Accounts to open Multiple Instances of a Program:</h2>

 	<li>Now, a new account is created successfully.</li>
</ol>

 	<li>Next, you have to enter your username and password of the newly created account and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Another instance of the same program will open up so you can use it.</li>

</ol>
