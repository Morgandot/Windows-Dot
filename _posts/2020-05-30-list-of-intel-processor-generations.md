<h2 id="1">Intel Processor Generations:</h2>
[caption id="attachment_465" align="aligncenter" width="2560"]<img class="wp-image-465 size-full" src="https://windowsdot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intel-processor-generations.png" alt="Intel processor generations" width="2560" height="948" /> Intel processor generations[/caption]

It has an enhanced feature<strong> set and speed</strong> compared to previous generations. Then processor<strong> micro-architecture</strong> is the main difference in processor generations. Mainly the concept of generations comes after the release of the<strong> Core I series.</strong> Most people think that <strong>Core i3, i5, and i7</strong> are the processor generations but they are<strong> models or brands</strong> of processors from Intel.

Here, the <strong>generations of Intel</strong> were discussed in detail. Simply, follow the below information.
<h2 id="2">1st Generation Intel Processors:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>The 1st Generation Intel Processors – <strong>Nehalem</strong></li>
 	<li>In the year <strong>2010</strong>, Nehalem was released for production.</li>
 	<li>Nehalem had certain limitations like the inability to increase the<strong> clock speed, inefficient pipeline, etc.</strong></li>
 	<li>It used the<strong> 45-nanometer</strong> process as opposed to the 65nm or 90nm used by previous architects.</li>
 	<li>It was reintroduced<strong> hyper-threading</strong> technology, left out mainly in the initial Core i3 processor models.</li>
 	<li>It has a <strong>64 KB L1</strong> cache, <strong>256 KB</strong> per core <strong>L2</strong> cache, <strong>4 MB to 12 MB L3</strong> cache, and supports<strong> 1156 LGA</strong> socket and <strong>2-channel DDR3</strong> RAM.</li>
 	<li>It was the Intel processor micro-architecture which was the <strong>successor</strong> to the initial Core architecture.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3">2nd Generation Intel Processors:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>The 2nd Generation Intel Processors – <strong>Sandy Bridge</strong></li>
 	<li>It was introduced in <strong>2011</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Sandy Bridge micro-architecture was released to replace <strong>Nehalem</strong> architecture.</li>
 	<li>It used the <strong>32-nanometer</strong> process as opposed to 45 nm used in Nehalem.</li>
 	<li>The performance comparison between Nehalem and Sandy Bridge was about <strong>11.3%.</strong></li>
 	<li>It uses the same cache which is used in the Nehalem, but there is an only difference in the <strong>L3</strong> cache.</li>
 	<li>The L3 cache was from <strong>1MB to 8 MB</strong> but for extreme processors, it was from <strong>10 MB to 15 MB.</strong></li>
 	<li>Sandy Bridge supports <strong>1155 LGA</strong> socket and <strong>2-channel DDR3-1066</strong> RAM.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="4">3rd Generation Intel Processors:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>The 3rd Generation Intel Processors – <strong>Ivy Bridge</strong></li>
 	<li>It was introduced in the year of <strong>2012</strong> September.</li>
 	<li>These processors are <strong>faster</strong> than Sandy Bridge processors.</li>
 	<li>It used the <strong>22-nanometer</strong> process as opposed to 32 nm used in Sandy Bridge.</li>
 	<li> This processor model consumes up to 50% less energy and will give <strong>25% to 68%</strong> increase in performance as compared to Sandy Bridge processors.</li>
 	<li>The only <strong>drawback</strong> in this processor is it may <strong>emit more heat</strong> as compared to Sandy Bridge processors.</li>
 	<li>It supports <strong>1155 LGA</strong> socket with <strong>DDR3-1333</strong> to <strong>DDR3-1600 RAM.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="5">4th Generation Intel Processors:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>The 4th Generation Intel Processors – <strong>Haswell </strong></li>
 	<li>The Intel has released this generation on the year of June <strong>2013</strong>.</li>
 	<li>The Haswell uses the same<strong> 22-nm</strong> process as Ivy Bridge.</li>
 	<li>The performance improvement of Haswell as compared to the Ivy Bridge is from<strong> 3% to 8%.</strong></li>
 	<li>It can be used in<strong> ultra-portable devices</strong> due to its<strong> low power consumption.</strong></li>
 	<li>Haswell has features like support for new sockets (LGA 1150, BGA 1364, LGA 2011-3), <strong>DDR4</strong> technology, a completely new cache design, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="6">5th Generation Intel Processors:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>The 5th Generation Intel Processors – <strong>Broadwell </strong></li>
 	<li>It was released by Intel in <strong>2015</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Broadwell uses the<strong> 14-nm</strong> process technology.</li>
 	<li>It is <strong>37%</strong> smaller in size than its predecessors.</li>
 	<li>According to Intel, with the Broadwell CPU, the device’s battery life could be improved as long as <strong>1.5 hours.</strong></li>
 	<li>Its features are faster wake times and improved graphics performance in the <strong>Broadwell chips.</strong></li>
 	<li>The Broadwell supports <strong>1150 LGA</strong> sockets with<strong> 2-channel DDR3L-1333/1600</strong> RAM.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="7">6th Generation Intel Processors:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>The 6th Generation Intel Processors – <strong>Skylake </strong></li>

 	<li><strong> L4 cache </strong>will be introduced in this generation for further performance boosts.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="13">The next generations:</h2>
<ol>
