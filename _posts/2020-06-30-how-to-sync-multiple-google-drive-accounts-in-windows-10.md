<h2 id="1">Multiple Google Drive Accounts:</h2>
Google Drive plays a vital role in cloud storage solutions. It seems to be a favorite among users as it is the biggest cloud storage of 15 GB free. It integrated with other productivity applications such as Google Sheets and Google Docs. In this Drive, you can store your photos, documents, etc and share it with others who don't have a Google account.

The only issue with Google Drive is that it allows only one account to be synced on a device. Those who have multiple accounts will probably want to sync all of them. It is possible to sync multiple accounts by accessing folders through one main account. Let's check out the steps.
