<h2 id="1">When to cleanup drivers from Windows?</h2>
The <strong>Device drivers</strong> tell the Operating System how to operate a particular hardware device. It is an important component of <strong>Windows</strong>. It is a <strong>bridge</strong> of communication between the software <strong>Operating</strong> <strong>System</strong> and the <strong>hardware</strong>. Without drivers installed, Windows will not be able to communicate with the hardware. The <strong>Driver</strong> <strong>Store</strong> is known as which Windows 10 comes with a collection of trusted driver packages of the most common hardware from<strong> Microsoft and third-party vendors. </strong>

<strong>New drivers</strong> are available for a particular device, Windows will automatically try to download and install the<strong> latest version</strong> through Windows Update. Over time, Windows will keep on<strong> installing device drivers</strong> for all new hardware plugged into the PC like printers, USB devices, monitors, etc. While Windows keeps on adding and installing new drivers, it will<strong> not delete the old ones.</strong> The old drivers keep on taking up hard drive space and eventually will fill up the system drive.
